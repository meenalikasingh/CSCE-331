                When it comes to my technical skills, I focus not only on the tools and languages I know but also on how I can use them to solve real-world problems. I have experience with a variety of programming languages like Python, C++, R, SQL, Java, and JavaScript. I use these languages to develop applications, ranging from managing databases to creating interactive web applications like the dice game or wordle game. I also have expertise in full-stack development, which means I can work on both the front-end (using technologies like React.js) and the back-end (using technologies like Node.js) to create comprehensive solutions which I used in my recent MERN project (check out my portfolio for the details!). In addition to coding languages, I am also proficient in tools like AWS for cloud computing, PowerBI for data analytics, and Git for version control. These tools help me efficiently maintain and deploy scalable projects which comes in very handy in the corporate world. I am also knowledgeable in project management using Jira and have a certification in Prompt Engineering from OpenAI, which allows me to excel in interdisciplinary tasks and projects involving AI. I have a strong interest in software development, artificial intelligence, and data-driven technologies. I find it fascinating how algorithms can improve system performance, especially in AI-related projects where prompt engineering is crucial for model improvement. I am particularly intrigued by the synergy between machine learning and data structures, as I believe the right algorithm can greatly enhance user experiences and efficiency in technological applications. I am committed to continuously learning and staying updated in the field of computer science. Whether it's designing user interfaces or optimizing game logics, my technical skills help me bridge the gap between abstract concepts and real-world implementation.
